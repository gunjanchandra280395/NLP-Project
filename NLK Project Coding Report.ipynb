    "1.\tUse Google search API and msn search API in order to generate snippets associated to a given sentence. Retrieve the first ten snippets for each sentence. Design and implement a similarity measure that computes the number of overlapping words between the total terms of the ten snippets associated to the first sentence S1 and the first ten snippets associated to the sentence S2. So the similarity here looks similar to Jaccard distance.  You may find the following Msc thesis useful http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/users/wwwb/cgi-bin/tr-get.cgi/2015/MSC/MSC-2015-16.pdf "
